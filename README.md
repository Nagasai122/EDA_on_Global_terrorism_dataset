Exploratory Data Analysis &amp; Visualization on Global Terrorism Data set

Summary of the EDA capstone project on Global Terrorism Analysis 

Terrorism is one of the biggest global challenges faced by humanity, killing and wounding millions of people, and responsible for the long-term destruction of wealth opportunities and the well-being of people. 
Our project is an attempt to dig deep into data to find out the possible ways to prevent terror attacks, initiatives that can be taken for the short and long term for tackling global terrorism, and changing trends in terror attacks to effectively plan mitigation measures for the future.
